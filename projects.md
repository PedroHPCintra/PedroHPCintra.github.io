Some academic projects I took part during my undergrad and that contributed to my development, some others I'm still part of, doing research or just having fun in learning something new :)

# Microalgae Spectroscopy

### 2018 - 2019

**Description:** Techniques of UV/VIS spectroscopy to characterize microalgae species.

# Medical Physics

### 2019 - 2020

**Description:** Work at the Universitary Hospital of Brasilia (HuB) with focus on radiotherapy.

# Uncanny Valley Hypothesis

### 2019 - 2020

**Description:** Search for evidences on categorical classification on the brain as an explanation of the uncanny valley.

# Click Covid: Mathematical modelling of the COVID-19 pandemic

### 2020 - 2022

**Description:** Use of several epidemiological models and the Santos Dumont Supercomputer for forecasting of the COVID-19 pandemic.

# Supernova Observation and Distance Estimation using Neutrino Detectors

### 2021 - Today

**Description:** Can we use neutrinos as a probe for finding the location of a Supernova in the sky, that is, its distance and direction? Answering this question is the main objective of my Masters.

# General Relativistic Three-Body Simulator

### 2021 - Today

**Description:** This project started as a Hackathon challenge in the McGill Physics Hachathon in 2021. Today, me and some friends try to improve our simulations and investigate the stability of some orbits in three-body systems under the effects of general relativity.

# A Race for Survival: Chemotaxis in Bacteria

### 2023 - Today

**Description:** We investigate in which kind of scenarios is chemotatic behavior good or bad for bacteria that are being exposed to a toxic substance.
