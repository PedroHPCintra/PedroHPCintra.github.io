> **Abstract:** _The long duration of the COVID-19 pandemic allowed for multiple bursts in the infection and death rates, the so-called epidemic waves. This complex behavior is no longer tractable by simple compartmental model and requires more sophisticated mathematical techniques for analyzing epidemic data and generating reliable forecasts. In this work, we propose a framework for analyzing complex dynamical systems by dividing the data in consecutive time-windows to be separately analyzed. We fit parameters for each timewindow through an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) algorithm, and the posterior distribution of parameters obtained for one window is used as the prior distribution for the next window. This Bayesian learning approach is tested with data on COVID-19 cases in multiple countries and is shown to improve ABC performance and to produce good short-term forecasting._

<p style="font-size: 12px;"><b>Abstract:</b> Objective: The uncanny valley hypothesis refers to a subjective experience of eeriness to highly human-like objects (e.g., realistic avatars). There is evidence that objects at the human–avatar category boundary along the dimension of human likeness (DHL) are more likely to evoke the uncanny valley effect. Literature has focused on the affective domain of the phenomenon and studies on the cognitive demands are few. Here, we investigate whether perceptual ambiguity could affect the hierarchical processing of facial features. Our study investigated categorical perception of female and male faces along the DHL. Method: Participants performed a real vs. artificial categorization task and behavioral measures (categorization threshold and response time; RT) were calculated to determine avatar, boundary, and human face conditions. Results: An analysis on the hierarchy of gaze dwell time in regions of interest (ROI; eyes, nose, and mouth) showed greater dwell time for the nose area of boundary faces compared to the nose area of avatar and human faces. Conclusions: Results showed that perceptual discrimination difficulty changed the allocation of attentional resources in boundary faces. Such output may contribute on how we process artificial faces and might improve users’ experiences from highly realistic characters.</p>
